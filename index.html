        <h3>What is World Cup</h3>
        <img id="qualifyimg" src="https://cdn.britannica.com/42/244842-050-5332F78F/Pele-1970-FIFA-World-Cup-final.jpg" width="590px" height="450px">
        <p>The FIFA World Cup is the world's most prestigious and popular international soccer tournament, where national teams from across the globe compete to be crowned world champions. Held every four years by the sport's global governing body, FIFA, the event involves a lengthy qualification process, followed by a month-long final tournament in a host nation (or nations). It is a massive cultural phenomenon that brings billions of people together, transcending national borders and languages in a shared celebration of the sport. Beyond the on-field competition, the World Cup generates immense national pride, creates global storylines, and serves as a major platform for cultural exchange . The history of the world cup go back to more than a hundred of year, where the tournament begin every 4 years, to now that the next one gonna be in 2026, and will be in the US and Mexico.

        <h3> The two greatest World Cup</h3>
        <p>The world Cup go way back, and in history there many of them, but non of them can top the 2002 and 2014 World Cup. Which for some say is one of the best one, the most interesting one too. But other may argue that 2010 or even 2022, which is the most recent one is one that may consider the best, especially the final which the score end up 3-3 with Argentina winning through penalty shootout, and MBappe with a Hattrick, the second time it happen since Pele. While some of those are being debated to being the best, but for me both the world cup 2014 or World CUp 2002 is the best one that evr happened.</p>
